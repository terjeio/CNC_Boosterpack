CNC BoosterPack Rev T1.0 for Trinamic TMC2130 drivers (SPI controlled)

3-axis CNC addon for Texas Instruments LaunchPads with 40 pin interface.

Support for my HALified version of GRBL (based on 1.1), currently drivers has been made for MSP432 (black version), Tiva C and MSP430F2955.
NOTE: firmware is built with CCS 6.1, MSP432 driver is 100% CMSIS based.

Opto-coupled inputs, NC switches recommended.

Opto-coupled outputs with 200mA open drain drive for spindle on, spindle direction, flood and mist.
Can drive most relays and solenoids directly. 
Output section can be powered from internal 3V3 or 5V source, or from external source.
If powered from external source outputs can be made opto-isolated via jumper setting.

PWM-output for spindle speed currently directly connected to MCU pin (could be changed to open drain).

I2C (IIC) interface with selectable voltage level (3V3 or 5V) via level shifter, dedicated interrupt input.
I2C pinout compatible with my 4x4 keyboard project, supports jogging etc.

Optional EEPROM for configuration settings for MCUs with no internal EEPROM.

Trinamic TMC2130 driver breakout board compatible. On board MSP430G2553 based I2C <> SPI bridge for driver control.
